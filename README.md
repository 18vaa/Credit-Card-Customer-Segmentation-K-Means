### Abstract

This project aims to perform Credit Card Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on their purchase patterns.  This is crucial to businesses as it helps them to understand their customers and target audience in a better way. This can help them to provide a more personalized client service experience.
There are various benefits of customer segmentation - 
1) Improved customer experience
2) Improved advertisement
3) Improved product development
4) Increased customer loyalty


We have used  K-Means Clustering to perform credit card customer segmentation so that the company can define its marketing strategy. We have also used PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization. The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. 
The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.
We have performed the following activities as a part of the project-
1) Data preprocessing 
2) Perform data normalization
3) Dimensionality reduction using PCA
4) K-means clustering
5) Visualization
